## Professional Experience

**ConnectWave PlayAuto – 2.0 Engine Development Team**  
Seoul, Remote | Jun 2025 – Present  
- Enhanced and maintained shopping-mall integration APIs: tracked down and resolved version mismatches, reduced error rates by 25%.  
- Designed and implemented new mall API connector (e.g., “CREAM” platform) in C#, following RESTful principles and integrated alerting for operational monitoring.  
- Investigated and remediated server IP-blocking incident: introduced sequential proxy rotation, automated health checks, and Slack-based incident notifications, reducing downtime by 90%.  
- Collaborated asynchronously with cross-functional teams to triage production issues, perform code reviews, and drive incremental improvements via Git-based CI/CD pipelines.

## Selected Projects

**MOCO (Team Project)** Feb 2024 – Jan 2025  
- Solved N+1 query issues in Java/Spring by applying `JOIN FETCH`, improving API response time by 40%.  
- Accelerated MongoDB read performance with aggregation pipelines and strategic indexing, cutting average query latency in half.  
- Built real-time chat module using STOMP over WebSocket in NestJS, supporting 50+ concurrent users with minimal latency.  
- Strengthened authentication flows by implementing Redis-backed token management with TTL policies, reducing session errors by 30%.  

**GOGUMA API Platform (Personal Project)**  
- Migrated monolithic FastAPI service into Docker-based microservices architecture; configured Nginx as API Gateway for request routing and load balancing.  
- Cached scraped data in Redis with custom TTL and scheduled jobs, decreasing third-party I/O costs by 60%.  
- Introduced relational “lineup” join tables to enforce data integrity and simplify query logic.  
- Isolated LLM integration in a dedicated FastAPI container, achieving 2× faster response times through async request handling.
