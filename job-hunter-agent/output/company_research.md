# Role Context and Product Involvement
**Team Structure:**

- Each squad owns a “vertical” (e.g., Payroll API, Benefits Dashboard, Compliance Engine).

**Positioning:**  
- **Title:** Junior Backend Engineer (IC1)  
- **Stack:** Elixir/Phoenix backend, Postgres data store, React/Next.js frontend, GitLab CI/CD, AWS hosting.  
- **Scope:**
